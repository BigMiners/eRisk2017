	<TEXT> Small victory, but these insights also make it much more interesting in my opinion to watch other highly intelligent animals like whales and elephants. Here's a cool article[1] expanding on the point about matters of degree into areas where other animals might actually have cognitive capacities beyond ours.


Let's just say, our globe's legal systems have a hard enough time admitting all people have universal rights. It's going to take a lot more to change this pervasive mindset of human dominion over all species. Hell, we slaughter and imprison billions of animals for food every year; if we, as a society, can't even bring ourselves to stop eating them in every meal, what chance is there for anything even resembling rights? </TEXT>

Their are numerous links, pics and articles demonstrating a submarines ability to get in position, sink below a thermal layer and in complete silence launch a salvo of devastating weapons. The response from the carrier group would be immediate, total and savage but the sub is still invisible and depending on its next steps, stands a very real chance of surviving. Diesel Electrics and Subs using Air Propulsion drive shafts have long been discussed and studied to learn tactics to defend against. The Swedish navy 'rented' an entire Sub and crew to the U.S. Navy to work against, the six month tour ended up extending to two years such was the realisation that these subs were very dangerous to carriers and large capital ships

A carrier battlegroup is difficult but not impossible to attack. There is some vulnerability to submarines as well as cruise missiles that fly very low. The important thing to take into account, however, is that these weapons have fairly short ranges and are sophisticated enough that few adversaries posses them. The only "mid-ocean" risk would be from Russia (or a former Soviet country) that has a nuclear attack submarine. Non-nuclear submarines and cruise missiles will both operate within several  hundred miles of an enemy coast. The weapons of a carrier battlegroup are of sufficient range that they can stay outside of the range of these weapons and still attack the enemy.

Several countries have developed very quiet non-nuclear submarines. In a conflict, however, the ASW forces associated with a carrier battle group will be actively looking for these subs. The sub hunters are using combinations of active and passive sonar buoys, helicopters with dipped arrays, as well as other tools. While not every target can be defended like this, it is likely that a carrier battle group will be well defended.

Another commenter pointed out the risk of anti-ship missiles like the DF-21. There are several problems with those systems, not the least of which is that they would need to be targeted accurately against a moving target from a long distance away. Second, the ballistic variants look an awful lot like nuclear missiles, and so could lead to an inadvertent nuclear escalation.


**Aircraft carriers are a remnant of WWII and would not last long in a full-fledged conflict where modern technology is used**, but that is not their purpose today.  </TEXT>

the US fight against the Filipino "insurrectionists" at the turn of the century remains a blank spot to most Americans. There are some very good reasons for this. Most people don't like to be reminded that the US was an openly racist major power more interested in trade than in freeing the natives of the Philippines. It is disturbing to read about American heros like Teddy Roosevelt denigrating the "niggers" who inhabited the island, and soft-pedalling widespread torture by the US military (most notably the rather nasty 'water cure'). It is also interesting to read how many people did not value the islands that much themselves, but felt that they were needed to be our springboard to the China trade -- which was going to make everyone rich, of course! It took the Japanese empire at its worst to make the US look like a friend to many Filipinos, and this book tells why. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> An excellent telling of a period that most Americans and Filipinos know little or nothing about. With America's new ownership of the Philippines, we were drawn into a second conflict once the Spanish were routed. The insurrectionist movement against America brought about a bloody and savage war that cost tens of thousands of lives. The third phase was the attempt to subdue the Moros, some of the toughest and most fearless warriors on the planet. The troops involved thought they would only be fighting Spanish regulars and then sent home. Rather, many spent years fighting in jungles and swamps against a clever and determined foe, and many were then shipped off to fight the Boxer's in China in 1900, only to be returned to battle the often fiendish inhabitants of places like Sibago Island, Jolo and Samar. A classic account and ranks with "Muddy Glory" and "Little Brown Brother" to name but a couple. There isn't much written about this conflict, but the information is out there. These lessons should have taught America about getting involved in smaller nations affairs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  This is also a study in racism; how allegedly "superior" Anglo-Saxons needed to "civilize" and "Christianize" the Filipinos, many of whom were Catholic. Overall, this book is a good primer about a shocking and somewhat vile episode in American history. High School history teachers in particular should read this book and include it in their lessons about the outcome of our "splendid little war" with Spain. It is a sad truth that as a result of this conflict, America did not seem to learn anything about the nature of guerilla warfare with a people fighting to be free of foreign control. Our failure to profit from this episode helped propel us into another such quagmire in Vietnam, a nation not too far from the site of our earlier fiasco in the Philippines. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In fact, the US-Philippine War (the Spanish-Amercan War was over in 2 weeks - akin to the Blitzkrieg of the Iraq invasion), is the closest similar war in US history to the Iraq war. Exactly like Iraq, the Philippines went 3rd-order guerrilla instantly and bogged down US forces causing more blowback than any good achieved. Similarly the US resorted to what are now called "War Crimes, "Crimes Against Humanity" and "Genocide" in putting Filipino women and children into the Boer War invented "concentration camps" when the men from a village had gone to the Bundok ("mountain(s)" in Tagalog - source of our word "boondocks") to fight the guerrilla war against the Americas. This was done again in Vietnam as "protective hamlets" which were always involuntary and unviable for the detainees inside them. In Iraq, it was "every able-bodied man" who was put into a concentration camp or targeted by a drone.
The Fil-Am war started when the Americans had promised, in writing, to free Filipinos from the Spanish to form a new Philippine nation under Filipino rule, and then reneged on the promise. The phrase "our little brown bothers" comes from this era as the excuse to break the agreement. The attitudes are summed up in political cartoons of the time: 1[1] , 2[2] and 3[3] . This really no different from attitudes prevalent today about arabs and muslims. We simply call the all "terrorists" as a direct substitute for "nxxxxx" as used in 1899. Nothing has changed.
Today the US does the equivalent when it drone attacks wedding parties and funerals or puts innocents in concentration camps like Abu Ghraib or Camp X Ray to be killed and to attempt indoctrination which often failed. In the latter case, stronger guerrilla nationalists were created as a result (i.e. ISIS which is largely led by former Saddam-era Baathist-ex-military-officers).
Even today, there is still a smoldering nationalist, anti-American thread in Philippine society; it's what got the US bases (over 2,000 under Marcos) kicked out by Cory Aquino. That the US had to have 2,000 bases simply to maintain control tells you a lot. The same will occur in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The US also managed to coopt various guerrilla movements with only marginal success in the Philippines. The communist NPA guerrilla was CIA-owned by the 1980s and actively used against the Philippine government and society broadly to "achieve US policy" but the Muslim MILF/Huks BIEBER were. </TEXT>

Today the US does the equivalent when it drone attacks wedding parties and funerals or puts innocents in concentration camps like Abu Ghraib or Camp X Ray to be killed and to attempt indoctrination which often failed. In the latter case, stronger guerrilla nationalists were created as a result (i.e. ISIS which is largely led by former Saddam-era Baathist-ex-military-officers).


Even today, there is still a smoldering nationalist, anti-American thread in Philippine society; it's what got the US bases (over 2,000 under Marcos) kicked out by Cory Aquino. That the US had to have 2,000 bases simply to maintain control tells you a lot. The same will occur in Iraq and Afghanistan.


The US also managed to coopt various guerrilla movements with only marginal success in the Philippines. The communist NPA guerrilla was CIA-owned by the 1980s and actively used against the Philippine government and society broadly to "achieve US policy" but the Muslim MILF/Huks never were. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In fact, the US-Philippine War (the Spanish-Amercan War was over in 2 weeks - akin to the Blitzkrieg of the Iraq invasion), is the closest similar war in US history to the Iraq war. Exactly like Iraq, the Philippines went 3rd-order guerrilla instantly and bogged down US forces causing more blowback than any good achieved.
Similarly the US resorted to what are now called "War Crimes, "Crimes Against Humanity" and "Genocide" in putting Filipino women and children into the Boer War invented "concentration camps" when the men from a village had gone to the Bundok ("mountain(s)" in Tagalog - source of our word "boondocks") to fight the guerrilla war against the Americas. This was done again in Vietnam as "protective hamlets" which were always involuntary and unviable for the detainees inside them. In Iraq, it was "every able-bodied man" who was put into a concentration camp or targeted by a drone.

	<TEXT>Lets assume you are right, someone just lied about thermite in that peer reviewed study, this still does not
        detract from the point that all the evidence suggests that some form on thermitic material was used and thus the
        official government conspiracy theory is a complete made up fantasy story

        ____

        NIST claims that WTC 1 amp;2 collapsed due to jet fueled fires (just normal offices fires for WTC7) which were
        not hot enough to produce molten steel or iron, but also claim that if there had been molten steel or iron in
        the debris afterwards, it would have been irrelevant to the cause of the collapses. The evidence of molten steel
        or iron cannot be called irrelevant, given the fact that the building fires, as NIST pointed out, cannot explain
        it.

        -----------

        **Physical Evidence**

        -----

        * [Early in 2002, Barnett and two WPI colleagues published an analysis of a section of steel from one of the
        Twin Towers, along with sections from WTC 7, as an appendix to FEMAs 2002 World Trade Center Building
        Performance Study](http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_apc.pdf)
        * [Their discoveries were also reported in a WPI article entitled The Deep Mystery of Melted Steel, which
        said:](http://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html)

        gt; Steel which has a melting point of 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit may weaken and bend, but does not melt during an
        ordinary office fire. Yet metallurgical studies on WTC steel brought back to WPI reveal that a novel phenomenon
        called a eutectic reaction occurred at the surface, causing intergranular melting capable of turning a solid
        steel girder into Swiss cheese.

        * [Stating that the New York Times called these findings perhaps the deepest mystery uncovered in the
        investigation, the article added:](http://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html)

        gt;A one-inch column has been reduced to half-inch thickness. Its edges which are curled like a paper scroll
        have been thinned to almost razor sharpness. Gaping holes some larger than a silver dollar let light shine
        through a formerly solid steel flange. This Swiss cheese appearance shocked all of the fire-wise professors, who
        expected to see distortion and bending but not holes.

        * [In May 2004, the RJ Lee Group issued a report, entitled WTC Dust Signature, at the request of the Deutsche
        Bank, in order to prove \(to its insurance company\) that the building was pervasively contaminated with WTC
        Dust](http://web.archive.org/web/20131204202627/http://www.ae911truth.org/documents/WTCDustSignature_ExpertReport.051304.1646.mp_.pdf)
        The report listed five elements in this signature, one of which was: Spherical iron and spherical or vesicular
        silicate particles that result from exposure to high temperature

        * [In 2005, the United States Geological Survey \(USGS\) published a report entitled Particle Atlas of World
        Trade Center Dust, which was intended to aid the identification of WTC dust components. Among the components, it
        reported, were metal or metal oxides (which could not be distinguished by the USGSs methods). The primary metal
        and metal-oxide phases in WTC dust, the report said, are Fe-rich \[iron-rich\] and Zn-rich [zinc-rich]
        particles](http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2005/1165/508OF05-1165.html)
        * [Extremely high temperatures during the World Trade Center
        destruction](http://journalof911studies.com/articles/WTCHighTemp2.pdf)
        * [Journal of the American Society of Safety
        Engineers](http://911research.wtc7.net/cache/wtc/analysis/asse_groundzero1.htm)
        gt;The debris pile at Ground Zero was always tremendously hot. Thermal measurements taken by helicopter each day
        showed underground temperatures ranging from 400F to more than 2,800F
        * [Sources related to exceptionally high temperatures, and/or to persistent heat at Ground
        Zero](http://911research.wtc7.net/papers/dreger/GroundZeroHeat2008_07_10.pdf)
        * FEMA documents in their [Appendix C of its May 2002 WTC Building Performance Assessment Team
        study](http://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1512-20490-8452/403_apc.pdf), for sample 1, evidence of a
        severe high temperature corrosion attack on the steel, including oxidation and sulfidation with subsequent
        intergranular melting. A sulfur-rich liquid containing primarily iron, oxygen, and sulfur penetrated into the
        steel.

        * [Leslie Robertson, a member of the engineering firm that designed the World Trade Center, said 21 days after
        the attack: When we were down at the B1 level, one of the firefighters said, I think youd be interested in this,

        flowing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjmHqES_lto amp;t=40s)
        * [Ron Burger, a public health advisor at the National Center for Environmental Health who arrived at Ground
        Zero September 12, 2001, said: Feeling the heat, seeing the molten steel, the layers upon layers of ash, like
        lava, it reminded me of Mt. St. Helens and the thousands who fled that

        steel.](http://www.jhsph.edu/Publications/Special/Welch.htm)
        * [Joe Allbaugh, the Director of FEMA, said in an October 2001 interview on CBS: Its just too hot for rescuers

        disaster.
        * [Don Carson, a hazardous materials expert from the National Operating Engineers Union, said six weeks after

        * [OSHA respond to the underground fires and potential steam explosions](http://imgur.com/CCqRzAo)

        gt; Underground fires burned at temperatures up to 2,000 degrees. As the
        huge cranes pulled steel beams from the pile, safety experts worried about the
        effects of the extreme heat on the crane rigging and the hazards of contact with the
        hot steel. And they were concerned that applying water to cool the steel could cause
        a steam explosion that would propel nearby objects with deadly force. Special
        expertise was needed. **OSHA called in Mohammad Ayub and Scott Jin, structural
        engineers from its national office, to assess the situation. They recommended a
        special handling procedure, including the use of specialized rigging and instruments.**

        **Testimony from Other Credible Witnesses:**

        -----

        * [Greg Fuchek, vice president of a company that supplied computer equipment used to identify human remains,
        reported that sometimes when a worker would pull a steel beam from the wreckage, the end of the beam would be
        dripping molten steel.](http://gcn.com/articles/2002/09/09/handheld-app-eased-recovery-tasks.aspx)
        * [Sarah Atlas, of New Jerseys Task Force One Urban Search and Rescue, arrived at Ground Zero on September 11
        and reported that fires burned and molten steel flowed in the pile of ruins still settling beneath her
        feet.](http://www.sas.upenn.edu/sasalum/newsltr/summer2002/k911.html)
        * Tom Arterburn, writing in Waste Age, reported that the New York Department of Sanitation removed everything
        from molten steel beams to human remains

        **Videos**

        ---------

        [WTC2 South Tower, Molten Metal pouring out the North-East Corner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmuzyWC60eE)

        [Pouring molten aluminum into a pool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEEOkMW1CYI)

        [Evidence of fused molten metal and concrete]( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1WWAnCd_6lg) of extreme heat.

        --------

        The fact that the rubble contained steel or iron that had been melted shows that the buildings were destroyed by
        something other than fire and airplane impact.

        When all of this physical evidence is combined with the testimony about explosions from many types of
        professionals, the claim that the Twin Towers were brought down by nothing other than the airplane impacts and
        resulting fires is simply not credible

	<TEXT> Just don't smoke. Do something else instead. Do something good for yourself when you feel the urge to smoke. This is a technique that can be applied to many challenging areas of life. When you have a bad feeling creeping in, use it as a direct stimulation to do something good in place of it. It starts a new kind of habit and a new kind of addiction: getting addicted to becoming the kind of person you really want to be. Don't give up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This went on for many months, and eventually led to me just buying regular cigarettes again, rolling tobacco, and becoming a heavier smoker than I ever had been before. When I decided to quit again after seven years of steady smoking, it was extremely challenging, probably one of the hardest things I had faced up till then. I did it cold-turkey and didn't use any method other than distraction. I don't think willpower would've worked for me. I had to distract myself with life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is a large body of evidence indicating that cross-country differences in income levels are
associated with differences in productivity. If workers are much more productive in one country
than in another, restrictions on immigration lead to large efficiency losses. The paper quantifies
these losses, using a model in which efficiency differences are labor-augmenting, and free trade
in product markets leads to factor price equalization, so that wages are equal across countries
when measured in efficiency units of labor. The estimated gains from removing immigration
restrictions are huge. Using a simple static model of migration costs, the estimated net gains
from open borders are about the same as the gains from a growth miracle that more than doubles
the income level in less-developed countries.
