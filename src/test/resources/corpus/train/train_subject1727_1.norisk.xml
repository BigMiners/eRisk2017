	<TEXT> Who liberty is being infringed upon by Cliven Bundy? The liberty being lost in that situation is Cliven Bundys... the arbirary line being drawn in that situation is STILL THE GOVERNMENT...

Bundy in my view actually has a legitimate homestead claim on that land predating federal regulation. In the legal sense its a matter of original appropriation and mixing of labor with the land that the family has established. 

Thats not to say that the land isnt truly the property of Native Americans which Im sure used the land before whites. They have the claim of original appropriation and in my view a right to the land. but within the current legal paradigm Bundy has more right to the land than government... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thats completely different. Private property rights prevent that and even if you do I can seek compensation in the courts. Governments cannot own property. Borders are nothing more than the outlines of the territorial monopoly of the state.

Individuals have the right to travel while not infringing of others personal property. Just because foreigners enter the country doesnt mean they are just going to be going all willy nilly crazy and "come live in your house, eat your food and fuck your girlfriend..." lol thats obviously absurd.

I agree wholeheartedly that immigration should not be subsidized though. Just like it is not moral to prevent someone from following their own feet with the monopoly of force called government... it is likewise not moral to force taxpayers to pay for them... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most arent ready to identify all as human beings having the same unalienable rights. My liberty doesn't somehow become null and void just because I cross an imaginary line drawn arbitrarily on a map by politicians... Every individual has the right to travel to better his circumstances... 

The startling thing is that there are probably around the same amount of 'illegals' fleeing the United States right now for freer countries and better opportunities. 

I agree with your proposal. People are not 'illegal' just because government gives them that designation. They are free. The problem with immigration policy as this article points out is that it is subsidized. The drug wars affect also should be considered. By ending the drug war, opening up borders, and killing subsidies, the market will put these people where they are most needed and most productive.  </TEXT>
